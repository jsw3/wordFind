# wordFind

This is for educational purposes only. I adapted the code for the trie from the multiway trie in Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne's Algorithms (https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/52trie/TrieST.java.html).

Feel free to grab the code and run it. Be warned: I used a huge dictionary file to generate the words, so there will often be some crazy possible words.
